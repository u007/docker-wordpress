# Wordpress

A enhanced docker image of WordPress with PHP7 & Security Tools. Based on Official Docker WordPress.

### Wordpress Version

4.8

### Advice

The official wordpress Image use a volume for /var/www/html. We keep it for wp-config.php, because if you want edit this one you will have to mount it with -v /path/to/wp-config.php:/var/www/html/wp-config.php and sometimes you can see a similar error "./sedKdJ9Dy: Device or resource busy" because of an inode change.

We recommend you to use volume for wordpress but only for /var/www/html/wp-content. So you only keep uploaded files, themes and plugins. You are not supposed to change the wordpress core.
Simply choose what you want to do by using -v option.
```
docker run [...] -v /path/to/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content [...]
```

For security reason the default wordpress login /wp-login.php is hidden from bots.
> Use http://my-awesome-website/wp-admin-panel/ to access to your login panel
